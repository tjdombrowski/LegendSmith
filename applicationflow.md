# Application Flow

### Menu
* The menu is more of a simple header. There aren't that many things to access, but it allows you to read the about page or go back to your dashboard. It is only accessible when logged in.
* When not logged in, the only options are to log in, sign up, or view the About page

### Log In
* First thing the user comes across, unless already logged in. Then they would be at the Dashboard.
* Simple log-in screen. The only other things are a sign up link or you can read about the website.

### About
* Accessible whether logged in or not
* Gives an overview on what the website is about, and a simple description on how to use it
* Updates on the website are posted here.

### Sign Up
* Simple sign up page. Only requires an username, email, and password

### Dashboard
* The first page the user encounters when logging in
* Provides an overview of what the user is working on
* Shows progress on the user's current legendary (most recent, or what they want to focus on)
* Possibly allow user to sticky tasks, which would then show up here (optional, to be added on later)
* Also displays legendaries the user is currently working on, and allows the user to search for additional ones based on name or weapon type. Furthermore, you can filter by game requirements (either the base game or a particular expansion). You may either check whether you want to track this legendary or click on one to be taken to its page.

### Legendary Overview
* Brief information on the weapon, including picture and a total price estimation
* Your progress with the legendary is tracked either by selecting the option here, or by completing a task marked here
* Shows the four main items needed to create the legendary weapon, and some info on the necessary tasks and materials to obtain them
* Items can be selected for a more detailed view
* Rather than having more than one page for a Legendary, the template of the page is the same, but the data is loaded differently.

### Task Overview
* A detailed section on one of the four main ingredients for making the legendary weapon
* Sums the estimated costs of making this item, which updates based on what the the user completes
* Allows the user to check off things they obtained/tasks they completed
* Can go back to the weapon's overview or access the other three items
