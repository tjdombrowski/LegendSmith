# Tiresa Dombrowski - Individual Project

### Problem Statement

Guild Wars 2 is an MMORPG offering a diverse array of challenges and tasks for players. Among those is acquiring "legendary" weapons: powerful, flashy pieces of equipment. While pursuing legendaries is rather popular, they require significant time and materials to complete, and there's no direct in-game way to see all of this. Many players have to do their own digging around to figure out what they need, and plan how to accomplish that. 

The plan is to create a website that can be used to easily see the requirements of making a legendary, and organizing and keeping track of the various tasks required.
