            <h3>Black Mambo</h3>
            <div>
                So what'll it be, now mister Mole? Whispers Sloth in curls of smoke. Take a back seat. Or play pharaoh.
                Dance with me or shake your bones. Slow down, it's a science. He's been waiting to bring you down. Snake eyed, with
                a sly smile. He can hold you and shake you, child. Leopards laze each on plush pillows. Slender capes of red
                and gold. Paperback dreams in their deep doze. Twitch their toes to black mambo. Slow down, it's a science.
                He's been waiting to bring you down. Snake eyed, with a sly smile. He can hold you and shake you, child.
                Wanna play cheat, now says the Sloth. A domino flush to his nose. Tickle that cheek and take your throw.
                Pump your veins with gushing gold. Slow down, it's a science. He's been waiting to bring you down.
                Snake eyed, with a sly smile. He can hold you and shake you, child. We can hold you. We can hold you. We can hold you.
                We can hold you. We can hold you. We can hold you. We can hold you.
            </div>
            <h3>On Another Ocean(January / June)</h3>
            <div>
                Biding your time on the other ocean. Falling into line in the cold and damp. Wherever you run, you see
                all you leave behind you. Lies inside. Anyone you open on the other ocean. On the other ocean, on the other ocean.
                Was he not quite as you had conceived him? Did the color of the light hide the fight in the eye? Wherever you run,
                you see only eyes behind you. Lies inside. Anyone you open. On the other ocean. On the other ocean.
                On the other ocean. On the other ocean. So, do you think the smoke, it won't enfold you?
                Or there'll be someone waiting for you? Off in the distance, then? If only anything could change you.
                If only you knew what you claim to. If only every sign you cling to. If only they were so.
                Tune any eye into the ivy. And I won't bleed out if I know me. All I need oh don't deny me.
                You ended up too strained. Oh, I would lead it in the morning. Oh I won't even if I know it.
                All I need oh don't deny me. We're in the eye sometimes. Too young, too. Too young, too.

            <h3>We Are Gods! We Are Wolves!</h3>
            <div>
                The storm passed overhead, scratched our world to shreds. Close enough to turn our hairs' attention. Turn the
                air yellow for hours. Have you ever seen such power? Have you ever loved enough to destroy, your love. You
                could never love enough. Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us. Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us.
                Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us. We spent our darkest days howling at the moon. Close enough to see
                our low condition. Did you wish that we were one? Have you ever known your maker? Could you ever lead your son
                aloft, the mountaintops? You could never swing that dagger. Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us. Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us.
                Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us.

            Put your hand down, boy. Welcome to my zoo. Put your head inside my big black wild, while I can still help you.
            See the snake-baboon? Funky, chic, and smooth. Honey, can you spy the divine ape-swine, 'cause he can see you.
            I'm a man, I'm a twisted fool. My hands are twisted too. Five fingers, two black hooves. I'm a man, don't spin me a lie.
            Got toes and I can smile. I'm crooked but upright. And all I want, is just a little love. I said in purrs under the palms.
            And all I ever want, is breaking me apart. I said to the thing that I once was. I'm a man, I'm a twisted fool.
            My hands are twisted too. Five fingers, two black hooves. I'm a man, don't spin me a lie. Got toes and I can smile. I'm crooked, but upright.
            To the left now boy. Underneath the moon. By the thick, tan sand and the tall, thin grass. One more thing for you.
            See the distant flume? In the sleepy dunes. Makes my nerves clench close and my bones go cold, when I see that room.
            And all I ever want, is just a little love. I said in purrs under the palms. And I all ever, want is breaking me apart.
            I'm a man, I'm a twisted fool. My hands are twisted too. Five fingers, two black hooves. I'm a man, don't spin
            me a lie. Got toes and I can smile. I'm crooked, but upright.

        <div id="johnnybelinda">
            I came home in the morning, just a little bit ago. You lie asleep in our bed, all twisted in your clothes.
            And the rain came down, on our rooftop with a rhythm like this. Let the hair stand up on my shoulders, when you
            open your mouth. You said, "Aah...". You said "Aah..". So I wrote you a letter, etched into my forearm with the pen
            that you gave me. 'Cause if there's one thing I musn't fear, is that this is permanent, this is permanent.
            I wish that I was strong enough. I wish that I could give it up. I wish that I could change enough to be yours.
        </div>
        <div id="kettering">
            I wish that I had known in that first minute we met, the unpayable debt I owed you. Because you'd been abused by the bone
            that refused you and you hired me to make up for that. Walking in that room when you had tubes in your arms those singing
            morphine alarms. They had you sleeping and eating, and I didn't believe them when they called you a hurricane thundercloud.
            When I was checking vitals I suggested a smile, you didn't talk for a while, you were freezing.
            You said you hated my tone it made you feel so alone, so you told me I had to be leaving. But something kept me standing
            by that hospital bed. I should have quit but instead I took care of you. You made me sleep all uneven and I didn't
            believe them when they told me that there was no saving you.
