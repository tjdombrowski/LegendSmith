            <h3>Black Mambo</h3>
            <div>
                So what'll it be, now mister Mole? Whispers Sloth in curls of smoke. Take a back seat. Or play pharaoh.
                Dance with me or shake your bones. Slow down, it's a science. He's been waiting to bring you down. Snake eyed, with
                a sly smile. He can hold you and shake you, child. Leopards laze each on plush pillows. Slender capes of red
                and gold. Paperback dreams in their deep doze. Twitch their toes to Black Mambo. Slow down, it's a science.
                He's been waiting to bring you down. Snake eyed, with a sly smile. He can hold you and shake you, child.
                Wanna play cheat, now says the Sloth. A domino flush to his nose. Tickle that cheek and take your throw.
                Pump your veins with gushing gold. Slow down, it's a science. He's been waiting to bring you down.
                Snake eyed, with a sly smile. He can hold you and shake you, child. We can hold you. We can hold you. We can hold you.
                We can hold you. We can hold you. We can hold you. We can hold you.
            </div>
            <h3>On Another Ocean(January / June)</h3>
            <div>
                Biding your time on the other ocean. Falling into line in the cold and damp. Wherever you run, you see
                all you leave behind you. Lies inside. Anyone you open on the other ocean. On the other ocean, on the other ocean.
                Was he not quite as you had conceived him? Did the color of the light hide the fight in the eye? Wherever you run,
                you see only eyes behind you. Lies inside. Anyone you open. On the other ocean. On the other ocean.
                On the other ocean. On the other ocean. So, do you think the smoke, it won't enfold you?
                Or there'll be someone waiting for you? Off in the distance, then? If only anything could change you.
                If only you knew what you claim to. If only every sign you cling to. If only they were so.
                Tune any eye into the ivy. And I won't bleed out if I know me. All I need oh don't deny me.
                You ended up too strained. Oh, I would lead it in the morning. Oh I won't even if I know it.
                All I need oh don't deny me. We're in the eye sometimes. Too young, too. Too young, too.

            <h3>We Are Gods! We Are Wolves!</h3>
            <div>
                The storm passed overhead, scratched our world to shreds. Close enough to turn our hairs' attention. Turn the
                air yellow for hours. Have you ever seen such power? Have you ever loved enough to destroy, your love. You
                could never love enough. Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us. Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us.
                Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us. We spent our darkest days howling at the moon. Close enough to see
                our low condition. Did you wish that we were one? Have you ever known your maker? Could you ever lead your son
                aloft, the mountaintops? You could never swing that dagger. Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us. Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us.
                Give your soul to us. Give your heart to us.
