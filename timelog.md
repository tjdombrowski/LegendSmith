Attempted to deploy the exercise to AWS, but ran into an issue where I was not connecting to it. I've attempted to retrace what I've done to see if anything's gone wrong, but couldn't figure anything out.

Altered my database description and added the ERD to reflect changes I've made. I also edited the application flow and redesigned the wireframes and jsps to reflect some shuffling around of how I want my project to look and act. I also attempted to figure out my issue with my join table using hibernate, but couldn't get anywhere. Lastly, I replaced my entity-specific daos with a generic dao and changed the tests and controller class to reflect this.
